For quick installation from a distribution tar file
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Assuming a Linux operating system(*), and starting in the directory
containing the tar file:
>  tar zxf flaps-XXX.tar.gz
will create a directory "flaps-XXX", the Flaps root directory,
populated with the source files necessary to build Flaps.

If this is the first time installing Flaps it may be necessary to
install certain packages; the PACKAGES in the Flaps root directory
can be run as a script like this:
> yes | sudo PACKAGES
note that it is usually necessary to run it as superuser with sudo.
PACKAGES will try to determine if this Linux uses apt or rpm for
package management.

Once you have the necessary packages installed all you should have
to do is
>  cd flaps-XXX
>  . ./Profile
>  ./configure
>  make install

If this is successful you can run some tests:

>  cd demo
>  run all

If the build is not succesful it may be because some packages
were not installed, or it may be necessary to adjust environment
variables that are set when Profile is "sourced".
Or maybe it is time to text or email

(*) there are hundreds of Linux distibutions; the important thing here is
    the package manager used. The 3 main package managers used in Linux
	 distros are apt, dnf (yum), and pacman. The PACKAGE script used here
	 lists the packages for apt and dnf; it should be easy to modify them
	 to work with pacman, which is used in distros based on Arch Linux.
	 Likewise for the less-used package managers like portage, zypper, and xbps.
