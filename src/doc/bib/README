Files:

flaps.bib: the main bibliography file - all entries should go here

Checking the validity of the bibliography entries:
-------------------------------------------------
A pdf file of the bibliography is produced by the command "make",
which produces "bib.pdf" from bib.tex and flaps.bib. The bibliographic
style is determined by the next-to-last line of bib.tex:
\bibliographystyle{plain}
Instead of "plain" you can use "aiaa" or "mdpi" or any other
that has a .bst file in this directory

Documentation of BibTex is in ./doc/btxdoc.pdf including a list of
all bib item types (article, book, etc)
