                                see Reference Coordinate Direction above

                   Also note that the modal mass in record 8 is calculated
                   from the parameter table by I-DEAS Test.

          9        Any Record With All 0.0's Data Entries Need Not (But
                      May) Appear.

          10       A Direct Result Of 9 Is That If No Records 9 And 10
                      Appear, All Data For The Data Set Is 0.0.

          11       When New Analysis Types Are Added, Record 7 Fields 1
                      And 2 Are Always > Or = 1 With Dummy Integer And
                      Real Zero Data If Data Is Not Required. If Complex
                      Data Is Needed, It Is Treated As Two Real Numbers,
                      Real Part Followed By Imaginary Point.

          12       Dataloaders Use The Following ID Line Convention:

             Record 1: FORMAT(3I10)
                       Field 1 -    trace line number
                       Field 2 -    number of nodes defining trace line
                                    (maximum of 250)
                       Field 3 -    color

             Record 2: FORMAT(80A1)
                       Field 1 -    Identification line

             Record 3: FORMAT(8I10)
                       Field 1 -    nodes defining trace line
                               =    > 0 draw line to node
                               =    0 move to node (a move to the first
                                    node is implied)
             Notes: 1) MODAL-PLUS node numbers must not exceed 8000.
                    2) Identification line may not be blank.
                    3) Systan only uses the first 60 characters of the
                       identification text.
                    4) MODAL-PLUS does not support trace lines longer than
                       125 nodes.
                    5) Supertab only uses the first 40 characters of the
                       identification line for a name.
                    6) Repeat Datasets for each Trace_Line
