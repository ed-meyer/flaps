Hi Caroline,
I'm writing to tell you about a flutter program I plan on releasing
as open source. Called Flaps, it is similar to Apex in terms of
functionality, but it is re-designed and written in modern C++.  I wrote
Flaps to support papers I began writing when I retired in 2012.  Because I
needed test cases I added simple beam, doublet-lattice, and propeller
aero modeling, which I am hoping will make it useful as a teaching aid.

I've lost track of Boeing flutter personel, so I'm reaching out to you
in hopes you can contact the appropriate people if there is interest
in picking up Flaps. Also, I would be happy to provide details of new
features in Flaps if necessary.

Thanks in advance for your time and consideration
