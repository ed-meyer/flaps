	Creating figures with xfig
	==========================

Assuming the git repository is in ~/git/papers and the build is in ~/git/pub

To create from a vis plot for paper "latent.tex", for example from vso.esa:

	- in ~/git/pub/latent/figures:
		- in vis -> hardcopy -> xfig -> to file -> ok  (creates vis.fig locally)
		- cp vis.fig ~/git/papers/latent/figures/vso.fig

	- in ~/git/papers/latent/figures:
		- if template.fig has not been created, create it in xfig: only the
			plot outline, dummy titles, and axis scale numbers. git add template.fig
		- git add vso.fig
		- vi vso.fig -> rm all but curves
		- xfig vso.fig -> group curves -> merge template.fig -> scale curves
			to fit
		- save; add to Makefile

If the fig contains Latex math:
==============================
Here is a simplified way to add Latex fonts using script "fig2pdf"
in papers/bin.
1) be sure to set "special text" mode when adding text
   See the example of what the .fig file should look like below
	fields 6 and 9 should be 2
2) math must be enclosed in $$ and \ must be escaped, e.g. $\\eta$
3) run* "fig2pdf file.fig" to create file.pdf or put

.SUFFIXES:	.fig .pdf
.fig.pdf:
	fig2pdf $<

   into a Makefile, then you can just type "make file.pdf"

*Note (11/26/2022): I now use fig2mpdf which is in package fig2dev (see /var/lib/dpkg/info/fig2dev.list)
