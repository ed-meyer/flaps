How to setup a computer after a new Linux installation assuming
an apt-based Linux distro (Debian, Ubuntu, etc)

- Get insync:
    scp 192.168.1.17:Downloads/insync_3.8.6.50504-bookworm_amd64.deb Downloads
	 or download from my Google Drive/system

- add you to the sudoers file: as root create a file in /etc/sudoers.d
  that looks like this:
	eem2314 ALL=(ALL)		ALL
  the file can be called anything.
  Alternatively, add you to the "sudo" group:
  > su
  > /sbin/adduser eem2314 sudo
  and make sure there is a line (uncommented) in /etc/sudoers like
     sudo	ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

- install insync:
     sudo dpkg -i Downloads/insync*.deb

- start insync: insync start
  sync with Google Drive eem2314:
  		- bin
		- system
	ln -s ~/Insync/eem2314@gmail.com/'Google Drive'/system system
	ln -s ~/Insync/eem2314@gmail.com/'Google Drive'/bin bin
	cp system/profile .profile
	cp system/kshrc .bashrc
