- 2 phases of flutter prediction: analysis and flight test
	- everyone believes the flight test except the guy who ran the test,
	  no one believes the analysis except the person who did the analysis
- 2 types of flutter:
	-  destructive: amplitudes grow so large parts break
	-  LCO: amplitudes grow to a certain size then stay constant
- 2 types of flutter solution: time domain, freq domain

- desctructive:
	- electra
	-  awacs
- LCO
	- 37 elevator
	- windtunnelLCO video

- Vibration problem
- add struct damping: complex
- add aero: complicates eigensolution
- add gyro, viscous damping, controls: hard or impossible to solve as an eigenvalue problem

- Introduction of Numerical Continuation
- Solving using continuation
- Some flutter problems in commercial airplanes
	- basic flutter
	- parameter variations
	- optimization
	- contours
	- control systems
	- nonlinearities
- Open source implementation: Flaps
