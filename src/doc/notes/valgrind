callgrind is giving this message:

==504955== brk segment overflow in thread #1: can't grow to 0x484e000
==504955== (see section Limitations in user manual)
==504955== NOTE: further instances of this message will not be shown

which means it is hitting a limit in brk() hard-coded in valgrind.
Following advice in
stackoverflow.com/questions/35129135/valgrind-reporting-a-segment-overflow
I downloaded the source and edited coregrind/m_initimg/initimg-linux.c
and changed line 1150 from
      SizeT m8 = 8 * m1;
to
      SizeT m8 = 32 * m1;
