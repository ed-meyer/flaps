- performs the many parameter studies necessary to design and certify
  aircraft free of flutter instabilities

- taking advantage of modern computer hardware, many parameter studies
  are done simultaneously

- more realistic analyses can be performed by including multiple
  nonlinearities and tracing curves of limit cycle oscillations
  (LCO), including latent LCO, which are nearly impossible to find
  any other way.

- because it does continuous parameter variations there is none of
  the confusion between aeroelastic modes traditional methods
  suffer from
 
- Flaps capabilities can be expanded by including custom computer
  code and defining new parameters; typical uses for custom code
  include defining controls equations and including unusual
  nonlinearities.

- an optimization method can be used to adjust models
  to match flight tests or search for latent LCO in addition to
  searching for optimal solutions in some sense.

- the motion of the aircraft can be visualized by clicking on
  the desired point on any of the curves produced, giving the
  engineer added insight into flutter mechanisms
